# Sample.CocoaPods.Umbrella

A sample project that uses a dyanmic framework that links multiple static frameworks from CocoaPods.

Updates:
  - Here is a plugin for CocoaPods to build as static-library
  - https://github.com/joncardasis/cocoapods-user-defined-build-types

## What's this?

Regarding [Reducing Your App's Launch Time](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/reducing-your-app-s-launch-time), in In the case of using a bunch of dynamic frameworks, App launch time might be slow.  
In this case, merging multiple frameworks into a large dynamic framework solves this issue.

This project shows you how to create a merged dynamic framework with building pods as a static-framework.

(From iOS13, Thanks to Apple unlocked the limitation of dyld3 for the third-party application, we don't need to do this approach actually in most of the cases.)
